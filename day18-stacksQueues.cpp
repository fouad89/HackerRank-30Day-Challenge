/* 
defenition: 
    A stack pushes a new element to the top of the stack and also pops the element at the top. 
    A queue, however, dequeues (removes) an element from the top of the queue, â€‹but it enqueues (inserts) an element at the bottom.

Write the following declarations and implementations:

Two instance variables: one for your stack, and one for your queue.
A void pushCharacter(char ch) method that pushes a character onto a stack.
A void enqueueCharacter(char ch) method that enqueues a character in the queue instance variable.
A char popCharacter() method that pops and returns the character at the top of the stack instance variable.
A char dequeueCharacter() method that dequeues and returns the first character in the queue instance variable.
